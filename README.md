# genomeUtils

Scripts for performing simple yet tedious tasks such as retrieving gene coordinates or DNA sequences.

## Getting started

To start using these scripts you need to clone this repository and submodules as follows:

    git clone --recursive https://github.com/gantzgraf/genomeUtils.git

The following scripts are provided: 
    
 * coordinatesFromGenes.pl 
 * dnaFromCoordinates.pl
 * genesOverlappingCoordinates.pl
 * getCrossRefIds.pl
 * seqFromId.pl
 * varInfo.pl
 
Instructions for running each script should be provided by their own usage information accessible by running with '-h' flag.
